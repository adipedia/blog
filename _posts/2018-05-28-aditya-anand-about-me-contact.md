## Chatuskoti

Buddhist philosophy has a very nuanced view of the ‘Truth’. One such idea is a principle called Chatuskoti. Chatuskoti insists that reasoning and logic go beyond true or false. Chatuskoti embraces the contradiction and the unknown.

‘Truth’ is also a fluid concept. Everyone once believed that the earth was flat. Doctors used to endorse cigarettes. I was taught that Pluto is a planet. As we observe the world more closely many old truths become mistaken beliefs.

The blog title - Chatuskoti - is a personal reminder to remember this nature of truth. Its contradictions and its impermanence; and that we must not forget to challenge our beliefs. I do this in the hope that a more curious, humble and observing mind is better suited to learn about the nature of the self and the world.

This blog is a diary of my observations and beliefs. To reflect on my experiences and to connect the dots. To form new beliefs and to seek the truth.


## About Me


My name is Aditya Anand. I currently live in Bangalore. I turn 30 this year. It evokes enough emotion to merit a post.

I’m a mechanical engineer by degree. I've been involved in [all kinds of jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-anand-ab870210/). From peddling laptops in a shopping mall to managing products with millions of users. I currently work at Practo where I build AI analytics tools for healthcare.

I've been very fortunate to have built a career around my passions. My fondest memories involve a computer. Being a maker and making things is part of an ethic I enjoy.

Apart from software, technology and design -- I also identify as an entrepreneur. On good days it brings extreme satisfaction and joy. On bad days nothing but misery and hair-loss. Never ever a dull day though. It's hardly surprising that I also like roller-coasters, adventure and triathlons.

My father, who studied liberal arts, has been a strong influence. I like reading things across formats and genres. I follow social affairs and politics. Sometimes, I try to be more than a slacktivist. My politics tilts to the left of center. With many exceptions.

I enjoy conversations and meeting new people. Serendipity and karma are funny and beautiful things. Don't be shy. Drop me an email. I'll thank you for it.
