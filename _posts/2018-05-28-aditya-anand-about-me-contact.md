## Chatuskoti

We once believed that the earth is flat. Our beliefs are our truths. Our truths are our beliefs. 

‘Chatuskoti’ is an ancient buddhist concept. It describes the nature of truth. Statements can be: a) True b) False c) Neither true nor false d) Both true and false. A four-cornered truth. 

A belief that ‘truth’ is neither universal nor absolute is powerful. It promotes humility and curiosity.

We once believed that the earth is the centre of the universe. Imagine if we stopped questioning what is ‘true’. It is this extraordinary quest for truth, this curiosity, that pushes the individual and the society forward.

This blog documents my journey. To reflect and to connect the dots. To seek the truth.

## About Me


My name is Aditya Anand. I grew up across six states in India so I don't exactly have a 'home town' but my parents hail from rural Bihar. I currently live in Bangalore. I turn 30 this year. It evokes enough emotion to merit a post.

I’m a Mechanical engineer by degree. I've been involved in all kinds of jobs - Peddling laptops in a shopping mall, software consulting for megacorps, designing interfaces, running and selling a technology company, managing products with millions of users, and am building AI products. You can know more through my LinkedIn profile.

I've been very fortunate to have built a career around my passions. It's been one of my best decisions. My fondest memories involve a computer. There is a certain instant gratification, an evolutionary high, that I find addictive. Being a maker and making things is an ethic I find fascinating.

Apart from software, technology and design -- I also identify as an entrepreneur. On good days it brings extreme satisfaction and joy. On bad days extreme misery and hairloss. Never ever a dull day though. I guess it's not surprising that I like rollercoasters and adventure too.

My father, who studied liberal arts, has had a strong influence on my interests. I like reading things across formats and genres. I follow social affairs and politics and _sometimes_ try to be more than a slacktivist. My politics can be described as left of center with many exceptions. I try hard to avoid the label due to the groupthink associated with such identities.

I have a love and hate relationship with doing ‘healthy’ things. Some months I train for triathlons and hit the gym regularly. Some months I drink a few liters of cola daily. 

I value positive and critical feedback equally. I enjoy conversations and meeting new people. Serendipity and Karma are funny and beautiful things. Friend, don't be shy. Drop me an email now!
