## Chatuskoti

We once believed that the earth is flat. Our beliefs are our truths. Our truths are our beliefs. 

‘Chatuskoti’ is an ancient buddhist concept. It describes the nature of truth. Statements can be: a) True b) False c) Neither true nor false d) Both true and false. A four-cornered truth. 

A belief that ‘truth’ is neither universal nor absolute is powerful. It promotes humility and curiosity.

We once believed that the earth is the centre of the universe. Imagine if we stopped questioning what is ‘true’. It is this extraordinary quest for truth, this curiosity, that pushes the individual and the society forward.

This blog documents my journey. To reflect and to connect the dots. To seek the truth.

## About Me


My name is Aditya Anand. I currently live in Bangalore. I turn 30 this year. It evokes enough emotion to merit a post.

I’m a mechanical engineer by degree. I've been involved in [all kinds of jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-anand-ab870210/). From peddling laptops in a shopping mall to managing products with millions of users. I currently work at Practo where I build AI analytics tools for healthcare.

I've been very fortunate to have built a career around my passions. My fondest memories involve a computer. Being a maker and making things is part of an ethic I enjoy.

Apart from software, technology and design -- I also identify as an entrepreneur. On good days it brings extreme satisfaction and joy. On bad days nothing but misery and hairloss. Never ever a dull day though. It's hardly surprising that I also like rollercoasters, adventure and triathlons.

My father, who studied liberal arts, has been a strong influence. I like reading things across formats and genres. I follow social affairs and politics. Sometiems, I try to be more than a slacktivist. My politics tilts to the left of center. With many exceptions.

I enjoy conversations and meeting new people. Serendipity and karma are funny and beautiful things. Don't be shy. Drop me an email. I'll thank you for it.
